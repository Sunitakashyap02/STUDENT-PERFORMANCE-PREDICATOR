# STUDENT-PERFORMANCE-PREDICATOR
Machine Learning with Python: Student Performance Predictor for EduQuest Coaching
""" EduQuest Coaching aims to enhance student outcomes by leveraging machine learning to create a Student Performance Predictor. This system is designed to predict student academic performance based on a wide range of inputs, including past academic records, attendance, engagement in coursework, and demographic data.

By analyzing these factors, the model can identify students who may be at risk of underperforming. This enables EduQuest Coaching to implement personalized learning strategies and targeted interventions, ultimately boosting student success rates and improving retention.

This project utilizes Python-based machine learning tools to build, train, and evaluate predictive models, with a strong focus on real-world educational impact. """
